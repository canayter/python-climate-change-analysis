Our Current Research Questions:
Is there a correlation between rising temperatures and its effect on wine production?
Hypothesis: There is a statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and wine production.
Null: There is no statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and wine production.
Is there a correlation between rising temperatures and the creation of new wine industries in regions previously unfit for wine production?
Hypothesis: There is a statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and new wine industries.
Null: There is no statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and the creation of new wine industries.
Which geographical regions can expect to see an increase in wine production and which regions can expect to see a decrease in wine production given the expected rise in temperature?
Hypothesis: There is statistically significant difference in the expected change in wine production between geographical regions as a result of the expected rise in temperature.
We expect to see geographical regions traditionally too cold to grow wine to see an increase in production due to rising temperatures, and those traditionally ideal to see a decrease in wine production.
Null: There is no statistically significant difference in the expected change in wine production between geographical regions as a result of the expected rise in temperature.
